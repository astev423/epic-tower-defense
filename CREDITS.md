## I didn't make the assets/music in this game, I used freely available art from these people:

# Game assets
Tower defense and UI assets from kenny.nl: https://kenney.nl
Several towers (animated ones) from foozlecc https://foozlecc.itch.io/
Guns from vladpenn https://vladpenn.itch.io/weapon

# Music
Woodland Fantasy by Matthew Pablo: https://opengameart.org/content/woodland-fantasy
