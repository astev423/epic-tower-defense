"""
-Make waves longer, get waves up to 20 feeling good before going higher

-Add another enemy, one that takes double damage from cannons, is quite meaty and fast

-Different types of damage, blunt, explosive, piercing, energy, and different enemies weak to 
different types. Put them in specific groups

-I'm using too many class fields which makes code hard to reason about, use less and pass more things
in as parameters

-Add modifiers before users start map, like custom starting lives, money, start at specific wave, unlimited money, etc

-Work on UI, make start menu, let users exit map and go to main menu, add death screen that takes you back to main menu, and
in main menu itself let users click play then select map or see their stats (saved via godot saving), or red button for exit

-Add UI that shows on esc pressed with monster info, like their health, weaknesses, strengths, etc

-Make temporary powerups like towers do double damage, or all have infinite range

-Make towers only fire at first enemy instead of random, or maybe option like in btd5

-Add custom sound effects like hurt sound/death sound and add royalty free background music, maybe bossa nova

-Add fast-forward button via engine time scale or whatever its called

-Add death splat or explosion for big enemies on death
