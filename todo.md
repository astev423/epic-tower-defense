"""
-Add another enemy, one that takes double damage from cannons, is quite meaty and fast

-Work on waves, don't save waves until the end as that will be tedious and I won't have much motivation, make at least
10 waves with good amount of enemies and varying spawn times between them for plains level before moving on

-Tower ideas, flamethrower (aoe, short range), missle launcher (aoe, longer range), crossbow (low fire, 
high damage), machine gun (low damage, high fire), sniper of doom (unlimited range, super high damage
, super high cost, low fire rate)

-Work on balancing, show dps for each cannon in upgrade tooltip

-I'm using too many class fields which makes code hard to reason about, use less and pass more things
in as parameters

-Add more waves

-Work on UI, make start menu, let users exit map and go to main menu, add death screen that takes you back to main menu, and
in main menu itself let users click play then select map or see their stats (saved via godot saving), or red button for exit

-Add UI that shows on esc pressed with monster info, like their health, weaknesses, strengths, etc

-Maybe weaklings weak to sharp stuff, but some armored enemies immune to sharp stuff

-Instead of hard coding paths, reference other nodes via Scene Unique Names

-Make towers only fire at first enemy instead of random, or maybe option like in btd5

-Add custom sound effects like hurt sound/death sound and add royalty free background music, maybe bossa nova

-Add fast-forward button
