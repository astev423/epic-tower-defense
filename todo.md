"""
-Playtest, make sure can be done on medium and hard

-Get someone else to playtest, they likely can't beat game so make them go to level 40 after they die to see cool boss animation

-Refactor paths in ui, don't make them hard coded, when to use preload const vs variable in func, how
to structure paths and change scenes, learn this stuff

-Refactor placement and upgrade managers, use signals instead to communicate between

-Instead of hardcoded paths, use export and select scenes that way, godot automatically updates them
if they change paths

-make wave into resource
"""


Notes
-Good music, font, they all match well, background needs more work, for background add clouds or texture maybe
-Second screen, fix background also
-Explain controls, esc, right click, left click, unpause, etc
-Show spawn point
-Make it clear that brown is path, show controls and how to play page, explain how to upgrade towers, how
to see enemy stats
-Put name of tower and enemies in stats, at the very top
-Wave 20, 21, too many watery guys, nerf some waves, or maybe buff amount of money per kill on big guys
-On winning screen add some more stuff, like sprites
