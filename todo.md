"""
-Refactor spawner so it considers time to spawn next group rather than my weird workaround

-Make waves longer, get waves up to 20 feeling good before going higher

-Add another tower with low dps but infinite range, shoot laser as well, not too expensive

-Work on UI, make start menu, let users exit map and go to main menu, add death screen that takes you back to main menu, and
in main menu itself let users click play then select map or see their stats (saved via godot saving), or red button for exit

-Ui that shows when click on enemies to show their weaknesses and strengths

-Add modifiers before users start map, like custom starting lives, money, start at specific wave, unlimited money, etc

-Make temporary powerups like towers do double damage, or all have infinite range

-Add custom sound effects like hurt sound/death sound and add royalty free background music, maybe bossa nova

-Make towers only fire at first enemy instead of random, or maybe option like in btd5

-Add fast-forward button via engine time scale or whatever its called

-Add death splat or explosion for big enemies on death

-Let users make a custom level (only 1 group), they define enemy to spawn, time between spawns, and
enemy count, user also selects their own money to start with

-Get to 1000 lines minimum of code
