"""
-Make quick ice map, it should be hardest one, just a quick straight line, then mark each level according to difficulty, where plains medium, dunes easy, and ice hard, also give each level the same wave info

-Finish up all towers and enemies before working on waves, then after working on waves (atleast completing) 50 waves for plains, then work on ui and other stuff, make waves a bit longer also, they
feel too fast

-Add another enemy, one that takes double damage from cannons, is quite meaty and fast

-Different types of damage, blunt, explosive, piercing, energy, and different enemies weak to 
different types. Put them in specific groups

-Work on waves, don't save waves until the end as that will be tedious and I won't have much motivation, make at least
10 waves with good amount of enemies and varying spawn times between them for plains level before moving on

-I'm using too many class fields which makes code hard to reason about, use less and pass more things
in as parameters

-Add more waves

-Add modifiers before users start map, like custom starting lives, money, start at specific wave, unlimited money, etc

-Work on UI, make start menu, let users exit map and go to main menu, add death screen that takes you back to main menu, and
in main menu itself let users click play then select map or see their stats (saved via godot saving), or red button for exit

-Add UI that shows on esc pressed with monster info, like their health, weaknesses, strengths, etc

-Maybe weaklings weak to sharp stuff, but some armored enemies immune to sharp stuff

-Instead of hard coding paths, reference other nodes via Scene Unique Names

-Make towers only fire at first enemy instead of random, or maybe option like in btd5

-Add custom sound effects like hurt sound/death sound and add royalty free background music, maybe bossa nova

-Add fast-forward button
